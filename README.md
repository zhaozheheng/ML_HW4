CS6375 Performance of classifier comparison

In this assignment, you will compare performance of classifiers on a chosen dataset. Below is
the list of classifiers you have learned in class:

• Decision Trees

• Perceptron (usually specified as a neural net with 0 hidden layers)

• Neural Net

• Deep Learning

• SVM

• naïve Bayes

• Logistic Regression

• k-Nearest Neighbors

• Bagging

• Random Forests

• AdaBoost

• Gradient Boosting

The idea is to choose a single dataset and run all of these classifiers on that dataset using the best
set of parameters for each case, and then compare their performance. This is more of a data
science assignment, rather than a programming one. You will be allowed to use any open source
machine learning library, such as R, Python's scikit-learn, or TensorFlow.

If you decide to do this assignment in R, a good place to search for packages is the RSeek website
at http://www.rseek.org. Please make an effort to learn packages or any other software tool that
you use.
